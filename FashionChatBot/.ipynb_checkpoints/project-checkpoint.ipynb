Despite the return to maximalism in certain fashion circles, the vast majority of Americans were still choosing comfortable clothing. This preference for comfortable and affordable clothing can be attributed to the growing emphasis on casual and relaxed styles in everyday life. Additionally, the ongoing athleisure trend reflects a shift towards prioritizing functionality and versatility in fashion choices. Some people might blame the COVID-19 pandemic for the prevalence of casual clothing, but some market research indicates that athleisure never really went out of style. In fact, athleisure has been gaining popularity for years due to its ability to seamlessly transition from the gym to everyday activities. This trend is further reinforced by the increasing focus on health and wellness, as people seek clothing that allows them to stay active and comfortable throughout the day.',\n",

On social networks, many influencers constantly look for vintage styles to break from the dominance of massively advertised looks (that they sometimes heavily criticize), a classic nostalgia effect used in the fashion industry. The early 2020s saw renditions of the underwear-as-outerwear and explicit sexuality. Versace, Gucci and Prada made significant returns to latex-inspired styles. Pornhub sponsored an osé fashion collection in Paris. Brands became in demand of a very wide diversity of models (breakthrough of indigenous models).

Typical clothing included prairie dresses, blue gingham mini-dresses, white gypsy tops with multicolour Mexican-inspired floral embroidery, and hippie-style maxi dresses inspired by those worn during the late 1960s. Gingham and austerity-era floral patterns dominated the aesthetic.

      "2023 Fashion Trend: Sheer Clothing. \"Bare it all\" has been the motto since the end of the lockdown. In 2023,  naked dressing makes its way from the red carpet – where celebrities like Cher and Rihanna have been sporting the trend forever – to street style. From a cellophane-like dress, worn over a boldly hued maxi skirt at Tory Burch's spring 2023 show, to a frothy frock revealing undergarments at Victoria Beckham, the previously risqué trend is coming not only for your weekend wardrobe but even workwear.\n",

While sequins may feel over as soon as the clock strikes midnight on January 31, this year, designers are making a case for \"daytime shine\" – wearable separates that can spice up even the most basic staples like tank tops (see above) and blue jeans. While this trend comes in all metallic shades (gold, bronze, rose gold etc.), we are partial to the liquid silver look that can double as a neutral.\n",

      "In a diplomatic turn, designers have extended the lifespan of some noteworthy A/W 22 trends, continuing their exploration of them in 2023, ensuring we get adequate wear out of the pieces in which we've already invested. Elevated basics is one such trend. Last season, there was a clear '90s directive when it came to minimalism, with logo vests, low-slung trousers and tube dresses being hero items. Now, things have been pared back even further; sure, Y2K maxi skirts and oversized suiting are very much a thing, as witnessed on the runways of Peter Do and Roksanda respectively, but the silhouettes are cleaner and the colour palette looks more expensive; think shades of teal, camel and navy.\n",

However, if you're looking to invest in something you'll genuinely get the wear of, look no further. Between wide-legs and puddle hemlines, slouchy-fit trousers were one of the biggest trends of 2022. Now, for spring 2023, the best jeans will feature these same design traits. From high-waisted dark-wash flares at Tibi to Bally's effortless double-denim moment complete with floor-grazing lengths, looser-fit denim is resolutely where it's at.\n",

      "As the decade began, Y2K fashions of the Y2K era (late 1990s and early to mid-2000s) ) were a major influence. This contrasted with the fashions of the previous decade which took inspiration from early to mid 90s fashion. On social networks, many influencers constantly look for vintage styles to break from the dominance of massively advertised looks (that they sometimes heavily criticize), a classic nostalgia effect used in the fashion industry. The early 2020s saw renditions of the underwear-as-outerwear and explicit sexuality. Versace, Gucci and Prada made significant returns to latex-inspired styles. Pornhub sponsored an osé fashion collection in Paris. Brands became in demand of a very wide diversity of models (breakthrough of indigenous models). The covid crisis had an impact on fashion continuity, which Vogue described as \"chaotic, creative mix of idiosyncratic takes on what the post-pandemic world wants right now\". Ghesquière explored vampire looks for Louis Vuitton. \n",

A dressier, more summery variant of dopamine dressing, known as \"Italian garden party core\", incorporated Mediterranean-inspired elements of cottagecore, such as pink mary janes, white, green, baby blue or pink shirt dresses with fruit, leaf and floral patterns, straw hats, peach colored off the shoulder peplum dresses, and gladiator sandals.\n",
